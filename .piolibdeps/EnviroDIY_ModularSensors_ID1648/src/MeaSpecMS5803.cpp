/*
 *MeaSpecMS5803.cpp
 *This file is part of the EnviroDIY modular sensors library for Arduino
 *
 *Initial library developement done by Anthony Aufdenkampe <aaufdenkampe@limno.com>.
 * with help from Beth Fisher, Evan Host and Bobby Schulz
 *
 *This file is for the Measurement Specialties MS5803 pressure sensor,
  for which is used in SparkFun Pressure Sensor Breakout - MS5803-14BA.
 *It is dependent on the https://github.com/EnviroDIY/MS5803 library, which was
  modified for EnviroDIY_Modular sensors based on a fork
  from the https://github.com/NorthernWidget/MS5803 library, which expanded on
 *https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MS5803-14BA_Breakout_Arduino_Library *
 *Documentation for the sensor can be found at:
 *https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12909
 *https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Weather/ms5803_14ba.pdf
 *
 * For Pressure (sensor designed for water pressure):
 *  Resolution is 1 / 0.6 / 0.4 / 0.3 / 0.2 mbar (where 1 mbar = 100 pascals)
 *  at oversampling ratios: 256 / 512 / 1024 / 2048 / 4096, respectively.
 *  Accuracy 0 to +40°C is ±20mbar
 *  Accuracy -40°C to +85°C is ±40mbar
 *  Range is 0 to 14 bar
 *  Long term stability is -20 mbar/yr
 *
 * For Temperature:
 *  Resolution is <0.01°C
 *  Accuracy is ±0.8°C
 *  Range is -40°C to +85°C
 *
 * Sensor takes about 0.5 / 1.1 / 2.1 / 4.1 / 8.22 ms to respond
 *  at oversampling ratios: 256 / 512 / 1024 / 2048 / 4096, respectively.
 * Assume sensor is immediately stable
