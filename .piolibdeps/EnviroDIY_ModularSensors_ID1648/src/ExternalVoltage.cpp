 * This file is for the grove voltage divider (but will work with any voltage divider with an output in the range of 0 ~ 3.3v)
 * This is dependent on the soligen2010 fork of the Adafruit ADS1015 library.
 *
 * The grove voltage divider is a simple voltage divider designed to measure high external voltages on a low voltage
 * ADC. This module employs a variable gain via two pairs of voltage dividers, and a unity gain amplification to reduce output
 * impedance of the module
 *
 * Range:
 *   without voltage divider:  0 - 3.6V
 *   1/gain = 3x: 0.3 ~ 12.9v
 *   1/gain = 10x: 1 ~ 43v
 * Accuracy is < Â± 1%
 * Resolution: 16-bit ADC:
 *   without voltage divider:  0.05mV
 *   1/gain = 3x: 0.2mV
 *   1/gain = 10x: 0.65 mV
 *

 * Technical specifications for the TI ADS1115 can be found at:

 * Response time: < 1ms
 * Resample time: max of ADC (860/sec)
